Dewey-Lopez
=========================

NOTE: As of September 30th 2014, the website is down for reasons that seem to be related to a spammy botnet known as SEMalt. I will try to have it back up as soon as possible, but I am currently busy with other things. 


This is a personal website for the Dewey-Lopez family. You can visit us at: <http://www.deweylopez.org/>.
I created this because I wanted to learn how to make and design a website. 

Features:

* Personal blogs, with commenting functionality and an ATOM feed. 
* Personal pages which can be used to organize thoughts, blog posts, etc... Can be public or private.
* Blog posts, pages, and comments all use [kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/) - which is a superset of markdown, and can be used for simple LaTeX functionality. 
* Pictures can be uploaded and stored on the [Amazon AWS servers](http://aws.amazon.com/). 
* Uses the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework, tweaked to my personal taste.
* Includes a mood tracker which allows users to update, graph, and annotate their current mood. Moods can be created or deleted at will. ![](http://i.imgur.com/fK4RmFd.png)
